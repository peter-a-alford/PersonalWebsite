# PersonalWebsite
This is an on going project in which I am practicing my web development skills. I am continously adding content to it in the categories of personal, Job, Interests, Photos, Favorite Quotes/Books, and Resources that I use development and my other interests. I am using also to have as a website for my resume as it evolves and I practice my design skills.
