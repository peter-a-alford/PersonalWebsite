1. Personal Bio (Page)
    (Picture)
    a. Where I come from.
        I grew up in Renton, Washington with my family. My parents are Craig and
        Mary Alford and I have three older brothers. I was homeschooled growing
        up which provided me with a large amount of free time. In this time I
        would play with my cousins out in the woods and local creek. As I grew
        older I got into video games on the pc. During the summers I would play
        ultimate frisbee with my friends. Throughout most of my life I attended
        Trinity Baptist Church where most of my friends were. In my senior year
        of high school I began to attend Bellevue College where I got the
        equivalence of a AA degree. I learned American Sign Language while I was
        there. After this I got my first job at QFC working in the deli. The
        next Fall I began to attend Biola University in Los Angeles. While there
        I participated in intramural frisbee and Residence Life. In spring 2017
        I graduated with a BS in Computer Science and moved back to Renton.
    b. Who I am.
        I am first and foremost a Christian. I am currently a programmer with an
        interest in website design. Things I am passionate about include:
        masculinity, food, racial reconciliation, design, and Spiritual
        Formation. I am skilled at: learning, getting to know people, and
        listening.
    c. Where I am going.
        I would like to become project manager or something that combines coding
        and a larger amount of human interaction. I want to become better at
        listening to people and just being with them. I want to learn more about
        the above issues through engaging with people and self study. Overall I
        want to try to live my life with excellence.

    d. Quotes
        "Only a man of prayer can lead others to celebration because everyone
        who comes in contact with him realizes that he draws power from a source
        they cannot easily locate but they know is strong and deep. The freedom
        that gives him a certain independence is not authoritarian or distant.
        Rather, it makes him rise above immediate needs and most urgent desires
        or the people around him. He is deeply moved by things happening around
        him but he does not allow himself to be crushed by them. He listens
        attentively, speaks with the self-evident authority, but does not easily
        get excited or nervous. In all he says and does, he provides to a vision
        that guides life. To that vision he is obedient. It makes him distinguish
        sharply between what is important and what is not. He is not insensitive
        to what excites people, but evaluates their needs differently by seeing
        them in the perspective of his vision. He is happy and content when
        people listen to him, but he does not form cliques. He does not attach
        himself to anybody exclusively. What he says sounds convincing and
        obvious, but he does not force his opinion on anybody and is not
        irritated when people do not accept his ideas or do not fulfill his will.
        All this shows that his vision is what counts for him that he strives to
        make it come true."

                                            ~ Henri Nouwen, Creative Ministry

        "God, Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
        courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
        Living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time; accepting
        hardship as a pathway to peace, taking as Jesus did, this sinful world as
        it is, not as I would have it; trusting that You will make all things
        right if I surrender to Your will; so that I may be reasonably happy in
        this life, and supremely happy with You forever in the next Amen"

                                            ~ Reinhold Niebuhr

        "Calm me Lord, as you calmed the storm. Still me Lord, keep me from harm.
        Let all the turmoil within me cease. Enfold me Lord, in your peace."

                                            ~ David Adam

        "For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more
        grief."

                                            ~Ecclesiastes 1:18
