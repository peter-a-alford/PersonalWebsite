            <h3 style="clear:both">Where I Come From</h3>
            <p>
                I grew up in Renton, Washington with my family. My parents are Craig and
                Mary Alford and I have three older brothers. I was homeschooled growing
                up which provided me with a large amount of free time. In this time I
                would play with my cousins out in the woods and local creek. As I grew
                older I got into video games on the pc. During the summers I would play
                ultimate frisbee with my friends. Throughout most of my life I attended
                Trinity Baptist Church where most of my friends were. In my senior year
                of high school I began to attend Bellevue College where I got the
                equivalence of a AA degree. I learned American Sign Language while I was
                there. After this I got my first job at QFC working in the deli. The
                next Fall I began to attend Biola University in Los Angeles. While there
                I participated in intramural frisbee and Residence Life. In spring 2017
                I graduated with a BS in Computer Science and moved back to Renton.
            </p>
            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
                I am first and foremost a Christian. I am currently a programmer with an
                interest in website design. Things I am passionate about include:
                masculinity, food, racial reconciliation, design, and Spiritual
                Formation. I am skilled at: learning, getting to know people, and
                listening.
            </p>
            <h3>Where I Am Going</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to become project manager or something that combines coding
                and a larger amount of human interaction. I want to become better at
                listening to people and just being with them. I want to learn more about
                the above issues through engaging with people and self study. Overall I
                want to try to live my life with excellence.
