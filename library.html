                "Only a man of prayer can lead others to celebration because everyone
                who comes in contact with him realizes that he draws power from a source
                they cannot easily locate but they know is strong and deep. The freedom
                that gives him a certain independence is not authoritarian or distant.
                Rather, it makes him rise above immediate needs and most urgent desires
                or the people around him. He is deeply moved by things happening around
                him but he does not allow himself to be crushed by them. He listens
                attentively, speaks with the self-evident authority, but does not easily
                get excited or nervous. In all he says and does, he provides to a vision
                that guides life. To that vision he is obedient. It makes him distinguish
                sharply between what is important and what is not. He is not insensitive
                to what excites people, but evaluates their needs differently by seeing
                them in the perspective of his vision. He is happy and content when
                people listen to him, but he does not form cliques. He does not attach
                himself to anybody exclusively. What he says sounds convincing and
                obvious, but he does not force his opinion on anybody and is not
                irritated when people do not accept his ideas or do not fulfill his will.
                All this shows that his vision is what counts for him that he strives to
                make it come true." ~ Henri Nouwen, Creative Ministry

                "God, Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
                courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
                Living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time; accepting
                hardship as a pathway to peace, taking as Jesus did, this sinful world as
                it is, not as I would have it; trusting that You will make all things
                right if I surrender to Your will; so that I may be reasonably happy in
                this life, and supremely happy with You forever in the next Amen" ~ Reinhold Niebuhr
